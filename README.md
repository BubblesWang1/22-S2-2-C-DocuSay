## Project Overview

Nowadays, many companies work with paper-based compliance documents, which are prone to errors, poor readability, damage, and destruction, and some industry participants have failed completely to complete proper compliance documentation. The failure of mobile workers to complete and manage documents on the go is costing the Industry millions per week and trillions of dollars per year. The costs include financial losses, legal losses, time losses, security breaches, etc. The project aims to develop a virtual assistant for mobile workers, which is a voice-based form completion for document and automation management on the go, that is Docsay.


## Project Objectives

The Docsay project aims to develop an AI voice-based form completion for documentation
and automation management on the go. The app would be able to scan text to voice, read the text to voice, do workflow automation, and get analysis and reports. The Docsay app aims to save costs for mobile workers.
